### Lecture notes (verbatim)

<a id="lecture-6"></a>

### Lecture 6

<a id="welcome"></a>

#### Welcome!

* In previous weeks, you were introduced to the fundamental building blocks of programming.
* You learned about programming in a lower-level programming language called C.
* Today, we are going to work with a higher-level programming language called *Python*.
* As you learn this new language, you’re going to find that you are going to be more able to teach yourself new programming languages.

<a id="hello-python"></a>

#### Hello Python!

* Humans, over the decades, have seen how previous design decisions made in prior programming languages could be improved upon.
* Python is a programming language that builds upon what you have already learned in C.
* Python additionally has access to a vast number of user-created libraries.
* Unlike in C, which is a *compiled language*, Python is an *interpreted language*, where you need not separately compile your program. Instead, you run your program in the *Python Interpreter*.
* Up until this point, the code has looked like this:

  ```c
  // A program that says hello to the world

  #include <stdio.h>

  int main(void)
  {
      printf("hello, world\n");
  }
  ```

  Notice how this C program is more complex than the Python version below. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/hello0.c?download).
* Today, you’ll find that the process of writing and compiling code has been simplified.
* For example, the above code will be rendered in Python as:

  ```py
  # A program that says hello to the world

  print("hello, world")
  ```

  Notice that the semicolon is gone and that no library is needed. You can run this program in your terminal by typing `python hello.py`. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/hello0.py?download).
* Python notably can implement what was quite complicated in C with relative simplicity.
* Among the goals of this week is to be *more comfortable with being uncomfortable* not knowing exactly how to solve a problem or correctly, syntactically implement a solution: Searching yourself for resources to help you (within the course’s academic honesty policy)!

<a id="speller"></a>

#### Speller

* To illustrate this simplicity, let’s type ‘code dictionary.py’ in the terminal window and write code as follows:

  ```py
  # Words in dictionary
  words = set()

  def check(word):
      """Return true if word is in dictionary else false"""
      return word.lower() in words

  def load(dictionary):
      """Load dictionary into memory, returning true if successful else false"""
      with open(dictionary) as file:
          words.update(file.read().splitlines())
      return True

  def size():
      """Returns number of words in dictionary if loaded else 0 if not yet loaded"""
      return len(words)

  def unload():
      """Unloads dictionary from memory, returning true if successful else false"""
      return True
  ```

  Notice that there are four functions above. In the `check` function, if a `word` is in `words`, it returns `True`. It is so much easier than an implementation in C! Similarly, in the `load` function, the dictionary file is opened. For each line in that file, we add that line to `words`. Using `rstrip`, the trailing new line is removed from the added word. `size` simply returns the `len` or length of `words`. `unload` only needs to return `True` because Python handles memory management on its own. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/6/speller/dictionary.py?download).
* The above code illustrates why higher-level languages exist: To simplify and allow you to write code more easily.
* However, speed is a tradeoff. Because C allows you, the programmer, to make decisions about memory management, it may run faster than Python – depending on your code. While C only runs your lines of code, Python runs all the code that comes under the hood with it when you call Python’s built-in functions.
* You can learn more about functions in the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html)

<a id="filter"></a>

#### Filter

* To further illustrate this simplicity, create a new file by typing `code blur.py` in your terminal window and write code as follows:

  ```py
  # Blurs an image

  from PIL import Image, ImageFilter

  # Blur image
  before = Image.open("bridge.bmp")
  after = before.filter(ImageFilter.BoxBlur(1))
  after.save("out.bmp")
  ```

  Notice that this program imports modules `Image` and `ImageFilter` from a library called `PIL`. This takes an input file and creates an output file. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/6/filter/blur.py?download).
* Further, you can create a new file called `edges.py` as follows:

  ```py
  # Blurs an image

  from PIL import Image, ImageFilter

  # Find edges
  before = Image.open("bridge.bmp")
  after = before.filter(ImageFilter.FIND_EDGES)
  after.save("out.bmp")
  ```

  Notice that this code is a small adjustment to your `blur` code but produces a dramatically different result. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/6/filter/edges.py?download).
* Python allows you to abstract away programming that would be much more complicated within C and other *lower-level* programming languages.
* One of the trade-offs of using Python is an interpreted language, instead of being compiled (as we strictly defined earlier in the course). Accordingly, there is some (usually very small) slow-down that may not be expected in a compiled program.

<a id="functions"></a>

#### Functions

* In C, you may have seen functions as follows:

  ```c
  printf("hello, world\n");
  ```
* In Python, you will see functions as follows:

  ```py
  print("hello, world")
  ```

<a id="libraries-modules-and-packages"></a>

#### Libraries, Modules, and Packages

* As with C, the CS50 library can be utilized within Python.
* The following functions will be of particular use:

  ```
    get_float
    get_int
    get_string
  ```
* You can import the cs50 library as follows:

  ```py
  import cs50
  ```
* You also have the option of importing only specific functions from the CS50 library as follows:

  ```py
  from cs50 import get_float, get_int, get_string
  ```

<a id="strings"></a>

#### Strings

* In C, you might remember this code:

  ```c
  // get_string and printf with %s

  #include <cs50.h>
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main(void)
  {
      string answer = get_string("What's your name? ");
      printf("hello, %s\n", answer);
  }
  ```

  Notice how this C program uses the CS50 library to get user input. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/hello1.c?download).
* This code is transformed in Python to:

  ```py
  # get_string and print, with concatenation

  from cs50 import get_string

  answer = get_string("What's your name? ")
  print("hello, " + answer)
  ```

  You can write this code by executing `code hello.py` in the terminal window. Then, you can execute this code by running `python hello.py`. Notice how the `+` sign concatenates `"hello, "` and `answer`. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/hello1.py?download).
* Similarly, this can be done without concatenation:

  ```py
  # get_string and print, without concatenation

  from cs50 import get_string

  answer = get_string("What's your name? ")
  print("hello,", answer)
  ```

  Notice that the print statement automatically creates a space between the `hello` statement and the `answer`.
* Similarly, you could implement the above code as:

  ```py
  # get_string and print, with format strings

  from cs50 import get_string

  answer  = get_string("What's your name? ")
  print(f"hello, {answer}")
  ```

  Notice how the curly braces allow for the `print` function to interpolate the `answer` such that `answer` appears within. The `f` is required to include the `answer` properly formatting. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/hello2.py?download).

<a id="positional-parameters-and-named-parameters"></a>

#### Positional Parameters and Named Parameters

* Functions in C like `fread`, `fwrite`, and `printf` use positional arguments, where you provide arguments with commas as separators. You, the programmer, must remember what argument is in which position. These are referred to as *positional arguments*.
* In Python, *named parameters* allow you to provide arguments without regard to positionality.
* You can learn more about the parameters of the `print` function in the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print).
* Accessing that documentation, you may see the following:

  ```py
  print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=None, flush=False)
  ```

  Notice that various objects can be provided to print. A separator of a single space is provided that will display when more than one object is given to `print`. Similarly, a new line is provided at the end of the `print` statement.

<a id="variables"></a>

#### Variables

* Variable declaration is simplified too. In C, you might have `int counter = 0;`. In Python, this same line would read `counter = 0`. You need not declare the type of the variable.
* Python favors `counter += 1` to increment by one, losing the ability found in C to type `counter++`.

<a id="types"></a>

#### Types

* Data types in Python do not need to be explicitly declared. For example, you saw how `answer` above is a string, but we did not have to tell the interpreter this was the case: It knew on its own.
* In Python, commonly used types include:

  ```
    bool
    float
    int
    str
  ```

  Notice that `long` and `double` are missing. Python will handle what data type should be used for larger and smaller numbers.
* Some other data types in Python include:

  ```
  range   sequence of numbers
  list    sequence of mutable values
  tuple   sequence of immutable values
  dict    collection of key-value pairs
  set     collection of unique values
  ```
* Each of these data types can be implemented in C, but in Python, they can be implemented more simply.

<a id="calculator"></a>

#### Calculator

* You might recall `calculator.c` from earlier in the course:

  ```c
  // Addition with int

  #include <cs50.h>
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main(void)
  {
      // Prompt user for x
      int x = get_int("x: ");

      // Prompt user for y
      int y = get_int("y: ");

      // Perform addition
      printf("%i\n", x + y);
  }
  ```

  Notice this C implementation of a simple calculator. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/calculator0.c?download).
* We can implement a simple calculator just as we did within C. Type `code calculator.py` into the terminal window and write code as follows:

  ```py
  # Addition with int [using get_int]

  from cs50 import get_int

  # Prompt user for x
  x = get_int("x: ")

  # Prompt user for y
  y = get_int("y: ")

  # Perform addition
  print(x + y)
  ```

  Notice how the CS50 library is imported. Then, `x` and `y` are gathered from the user. Finally, the result is printed. Notice that the `main` function that would have been seen in a C program is gone entirely! While one could utilize a `main` function, it is not required. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/calculator0.py?download).
* It’s possible for one to remove the training wheels of the CS50 library. Modify your code as follows:

  ```py
  # Addition with int [using input]

  # Prompt user for x
  x = input("x: ")

  # Prompt user for y
  y = input("y: ")

  # Perform addition
  print(x + y)
  ```

  Notice how executing the above code results in strange program behavior. Why might this be so?
* You may have guessed that the interpreter understood `x` and `y` to be strings. You can fix your code by employing the `int` function as follows:

  ```py
  # Addition with int [using input]

  # Prompt user for x
  x = int(input("x: "))

  # Prompt user for y
  y = int(input("y: "))

  # Perform addition
  print(x + y)
  ```

  Notice how the input for `x` and `y` is passed to the `int` function, which converts it to an integer. Without converting `x` and `y` to be integers, the characters will concatenate. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/calculator1.py?download).

<a id="conditionals"></a>

#### Conditionals

* In C, you might remember a program like this:

  ```c
  // Conditionals, Boolean expressions, relational operators

  #include <cs50.h>
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main(void)
  {
      // Prompt user for integers
      int x = get_int("What's x? ");
      int y = get_int("What's y? ");

      // Compare integers
      if (x < y)
      {
          printf("x is less than y\n");
      }
      else if (x > y)
      {
          printf("x is greater than y\n");
      }
      else
      {
          printf("x is equal to y\n");
      }
  }
  ```

  Notice how conditionals work in C. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/compare3.c?download).
* In Python, it would appear as follows:

  ```py
  # Conditionals, Boolean expressions, relational operators

  from cs50 import get_int

  # Prompt user for integers
  x = get_int("What's x? ")
  y = get_int("What's y? ")

  # Compare integers
  if x < y:
      print("x is less than y")
  elif x > y:
      print("x is greater than y")
  else:
      print("x is equal to y")
  ```

  Notice that there are no more curly braces. Instead, indentations are utilized. Second, a colon is utilized in the `if` statement. Further, `elif` replaces `else if`. Parentheses are also no longer required in the `if` and `elif` statements. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/compare3.py?download).
* Further looking at comparisons, consider the following code in C:

  ```c
  // Logical operators

  #include <cs50.h>
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main(void)
  {
      // Prompt user to agree
      char c = get_char("Do you agree? ");

      // Check whether agreed
      if (c == 'Y' || c == 'y')
      {
          printf("Agreed.\n");
      }
      else
      {
          printf("Not agreed.\n");
      }
  }
  ```

  Notice how logical operators work in C. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/agree2.c?download).
* The above can be implemented as follows:

  ```py
  # Logical operators

  from cs50 import get_string

  # Prompt user to agree
  s = get_string("Do you agree? ")

  # Check whether agreed
  if s == "Y" or s == "y":
      print("Agreed.")
  else:
      print("Not agreed.")
  ```

  Notice that the two vertical bars utilized in C is replaced with `or`. Indeed, people often enjoy Python because it is more readable by humans. Also, notice that `char` does not exist in Python. Instead, `str`s are utilized. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/agree2.py?download).
* Another approach to this same code could be as follows using *lists*:

  ```py
  # Logical operators, using lists

  from cs50 import get_string

  # Prompt user to agree
  s = get_string("Do you agree? ")

  # Check whether agreed
  if s in ["y", "yes"]:
      print("Agreed.")
  else:
      print("Not agreed.")
  ```

  Notice how we are able to express multiple keywords like `y` and `yes` in a `list`. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/agree1.py?download).

<a id="object-oriented-programming"></a>

#### Object-Oriented Programming

* It’s possible to have certain types of values not only have properties or attributes inside of them but have functions as well. In Python, these values are known as *objects*
* In C, we could create a `struct` where you could associate multiple variables inside a single self-created data type. In Python, we can do this and also include functions in a self-created data type. When a function belongs to a specific *object*, it is known as a *method*.
* For example, `strs` in Python have built-in *methods*. Therefore, you could modify your code as follows:

  ```py
  # Logical operators, using lists

  # Prompt user to agree
  s = input("Do you agree? ").lower()

  # Check whether agreed
  if s in ["y", "yes"]:
      print("Agreed.")
  else:
      print("Not agreed.")
  ```

  Notice how we use `s.lower()` to normalize input, using the built-in `lower` method of `strs`. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/agree2.py?download).
* Similarly, you may recall how we copied a string in C:

  ```c
  // Capitalizes a copy of a string without memory errors

  #include <cs50.h>
  #include <ctype.h>
  #include <stdio.h>
  #include <stdlib.h>
  #include <string.h>

  int main(void)
  {
      // Get a string
      char *s = get_string("s: ");
      if (s == NULL)
      {
          return 1;
      }

      // Allocate memory for another string
      char *t = malloc(strlen(s) + 1);
      if (t == NULL)
      {
          return 1;
      }

      // Copy string into memory
      strcpy(t, s);

      // Capitalize copy
      if (strlen(t) > 0)
      {
          t[0] = toupper(t[0]);
      }

      // Print strings
      printf("s: %s\n", s);
      printf("t: %s\n", t);

      // Free memory
      free(t);
      return 0;
  }
  ```

  Notice the number of lines of code. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/4/copy5.c?download).
* We may implement the above in Python as follows:

  ```py
  # Capitalizes a copy of a string

  # Get a string
  s = input("s: ")

  # Capitalize copy of string
  t = s.capitalize()

  # Print strings
  print(f"s: {s}")
  print(f"t: {t}")
  ```

  Notice how much shorter this program is than its counterpart in C. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/4/copy.py?download).
* In this class, we will only scratch the surface of Python. Therefore, the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org) will be of particular importance as you continue.
* You can learn more about string methods in the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods)

<a id="loops"></a>

#### Loops

* Loops in Python are very similar to C. You may recall the following code in C:

  ```c
  // Demonstrates for loop

  #include <stdio.h>

  int main(void)
  {
      for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
      {
          printf("meow\n");
      }
  }
  ```
* `for` loops can be implemented in Python as follows:

  ```py
  # Better design

  for i in range(3):
      print("meow")
  ```

  Notice that `i` is never explicitly used. However, Python will increment the value of `i`. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/cat3.py?download).
* Further, a `while` loop could be implemented as follows:

  ```py
  # Demonstrates while loop

  i = 0
  while i < 3:
      print("meow")
      i += 1
  ```

  You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/cat1.py?download).
* To further our understanding of loops and iteration in Python, let’s create a new file called `uppercase.py` as follows:

  ```py
  # Uppercases string one character at a time

  before = input("Before: ")
  print("After:  ", end="")
  for c in before:
      print(c.upper(), end="")
  print()
  ```

  Notice how `end=` is used to pass a parameter to the `print` function that continues the line without a line ending. This code passes one string at a time. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/2/uppercase0.py?download).
* Reading the documentation, we discover that Python has methods that can be implemented upon the entire string as follows:

  ```py
  # Uppercases string all at once

  before = input("Before: ")
  after = before.upper()
  print(f"After:  {after}")
  ```

  Notice how `.upper` is applied to the entire string. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/2/uppercase1.py?download).

<a id="abstraction"></a>

#### Abstraction

* As we hinted at earlier today, you can further improve upon our code using functions and abstracting away various code into functions. Modify your earlier-created `meow.py` code as follows:

  ```py
  # Abstraction

  def main():
      for i in range(3):
          meow()

  # Meow once
  def meow():
      print("meow")

  main()
  ```

  Notice that the `meow` function abstracts away the `print` statement. Further, notice that the `main` function appears at the top of the file. At the bottom of the file, the `main` function is called. By convention, it’s expected that you create a `main` function in Python. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/cat4.py?download).
* Indeed, we can pass variables between our functions as follows:

  ```py
  # Abstraction with parameterization

  def main():
      meow(3)

  # Meow some number of times
  def meow(n):
      for i in range(n):
          print("meow")

  main()
  ```

  Notice how `meow` now takes a variable `n`. In the `main` function, you can call `meow` and pass a value like `3` to it. Then, `meow` utilizes the value of `n` in the `for` loop. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/cat5.py?download).
* Reading the above code, notice how you, as a C programmer, are able to quite easily make sense of the above code. While some conventions are different, the building blocks you previously learned are very apparent in this new programming language.

<a id="truncation-and-floating-point-imprecision"></a>

#### Truncation and Floating Point Imprecision

* Recall that in C, we experienced truncation where one integer is divided by another could result in an imprecise result.
* You can see how Python handles such division as follows by modifying your code for `calculator.py`:

  ```py
  # Division with integers, demonstration lack of truncation

  # Prompt user for x
  x = int(input("x: "))

  # Prompt user for y
  y = int(input("y: "))

  # Divide x by y
  z = x / y
  print(z)
  ```

  Notice that executing this code results in a value, but that if you were to see more digits after `.333333` you’d see that we are faced with *floating-point imprecision*. Truncation does not occur. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/calculator2.py?download).
* We can reveal this imprecision by modifying our codes slightly:

  ```py
  # Floating-point imprecision

  # Prompt user for x
  x = int(input("x: "))

  # Prompt user for y
  y = int(input("y: "))

  # Divide x by y
  z = x / y
  print(f"{z:.50f}")
  ```

  Notice that this code reveals the imprecision. Python still faces this issue, just as C does. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/calculator3.py?download).

<a id="exceptions"></a>

#### Exceptions

* Let’s explore more about exceptions that can occur when we run Python code.
* Modify `integer.py` as follows:

  ```py
  # Doesn't handle exception

  # Prompt user for an integer
  n = int(input("Input: "))
  print("Integer")
  ```

  Notice that inputting the wrong data could result in an error. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/6/integer/integer1.py?download).
* We can `try` to handle and *catch* potential exceptions by modifying our code as follows:

  ```py
  # Handles exception

  # Prompt user for an integer
  try:
      n = int(input("Input: "))
      print("Integer.")
  except ValueError:
      print("Not integer.")
  ```

  Notice that the above code repeatedly tries to get the correct type of data, providing additional prompts when needed. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/6/integer/integer2.py?download).

<a id="mario"></a>

#### Mario

* Recall a few weeks ago our challenge of building three blocks on top of one another, like in Mario.

  ![three vertical blocks](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/notes/6/cs50Week6Slide073.png "mario blocks")
* In Python, we can implement something akin to this as follows:

  ```py
  # Prints a column of 3 bricks with a loop

  for i in range(3):
      print("#")
  ```

  This prints a column of three bricks. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/mario0.py?download).
* In C, we had the advantage of a `do-while` loop. However, in Python, it is conventional to utilize a `while` loop, as Python does not have a `do-while` loop. You can write code as follows in a file called `mario.py`:

  ```py
  # Prints a column of n bricks with a loop

  from cs50 import get_int

  while True:
      n = get_int("Height: ")
      if n > 0:
          break

  for i in range(n):
      print("#")
  ```

  Notice how the while loop is used to obtain the height. Once a height greater than zero is inputted, the loop breaks. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/mario1.py?download).
* Consider the following image:

  ![four horizontal question blocks](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/notes/6/cs50Week6Slide075.png "mario blocks")
* In Python, we could implement by modifying your code as follows:

  ```py
  # Prints a row of 4 question marks with a loop

  for i in range(4):
      print("?", end="")
  print()
  ```

  Notice that you can override the behavior of the `print` function to stay on the same line as the previous print. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/mario2.py?download).
* Similar in spirit to previous iterations, we can further simplify this program:

  ```py
  # Prints a row of 4 question marks without a loop

  print("?" * 4)
  ```

  Notice that we can utilize `*` to multiply the print statement to repeat `4` times. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/mario3.py?download).
* What about a large block of bricks?

  ![three by three block of mario blocks](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/notes/6/cs50Week6Slide078.png "mario blocks")
* To implement the above, you can modify your code as follows:

  ```py
  # Prints a 3-by-3 grid of bricks with loops

  for i in range(3):
      for j in range(3):
          print("#", end="")
      print()
  ```

  Notice how one `for` loop exists inside another. The `print` statement adds a new line at the end of each row of bricks. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/mario4.py?download).
* You can learn more about the `print` function in the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print)

<a id="lists"></a>

#### Lists

* `list`s are a data structure within Python.
* `list`s have built-in methods or functions within them.
* For example, consider the following code:

  ```py
  # Averages three numbers using a list

  # Scores
  scores = [72, 73, 33]

  # Print average
  average = sum(scores) / len(scores)
  print(f"Average: {average}")
  ```

  Notice that you can use the built-in `sum` method to calculate the average. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/2/scores0.py?download).
* You can even utilize the following syntax to get values from the user:

  ```py
  # Averages three numbers using a list and a loop

  from cs50 import get_int

  # Get scores
  scores = []
  for i in range(3):
      score = get_int("Score: ")
      scores.append(score)

  # Print average
  average = sum(scores) / len(scores)
  print(f"Average: {average}")
  ```

  Notice that this code utilizes the built-in `append` method for lists. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/2/scores1.py?download).
* You can learn more about lists in the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range)
* You can also learn more about `len` in the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len)

<a id="searching-and-dictionaries"></a>

#### Searching and Dictionaries

* We can also search within a data structure.
* Consider a program called `phonebook.py` as follows:

  ```py
  # Implements linear search for names using loop

  # A list of names
  names = ["Kelly", "David", "John"]

  # Ask for name
  name = input("Name: ")

  # Search for name
  for n in names:
      if name == n:
          print("Found")
          break
  else:
      print("Not found")
  ```

  Notice how this implements linear search for each name. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/3/phonebook0.py?download).
* However, we don’t need to iterate through a list. In Python, we can execute linear search as follows:

  ```py
  # Implements linear search for names using `in`

  # A list of names
  names = ["Kelly", "David", "John"]

  # Ask for name
  name = input("Name: ")

  # Search for name
  if name in names:
      print("Found")
  else:
      print("Not found")
  ```

  Notice how `in` is used to implement linear search. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/3/phonebook1.py?download).
* Still, this code could be improved.
* Recall that a *dictionary* or `dict` is a collection of *key* and *value* pairs.
* You can implement a dictionary in Python as follows:

  ```py
  # Implements a phone book as a list of dictionaries, without a variable

  from cs50 import get_string

  people = [
      {"name": "Kelly", "number": "+1-617-495-1000"},
      {"name": "David", "number": "+1-617-495-1000"},
      {"name": "John", "number": "+1-949-468-2750"},
  ]

  # Search for name
  name = get_string("Name: ")
  for person in people:
      if person["name"] == name:
          print(f"Found {person['number']}")
          break
  else:
      print("Not found")
  ```

  Notice that the dictionary is implemented having both `name` and `number` for each entry. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/3/phonebook2.py?download).
* Even better, strictly speaking, we don’t need both a `name` and a `number`. We can simplify this code as follows:

  ```py
  # Implements a phone book using a dictionary

  from cs50 import get_string

  people = {
      "Kelly": "+1-617-495-1000",
      "David": "+1-617-495-1000",
      "John": "+1-949-468-2750",
  }

  # Search for name
  name = get_string("Name: ")
  if name in people:
      print(f"Number: {people[name]}")
  else:
      print("Not found")
  ```

  Notice that the dictionary is implemented using curly braces. Then, the statement `if name in people` searches to see if the `name` is in the `people` dictionary. Further, notice how, in the `print` statement, we can index into the people dictionary using the value of `name`. Very useful! You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/3/phonebook4.py?download).
* Similarly, one could implement a list of dictionaries:

  ```py
  # Implements a phone book as a list of dictionaries

  people = [
      {"name": "Kelly", "number": "+1-617-495-1000"},
      {"name": "David", "number": "+1-617-495-1000"},
      {"name": "John", "number": "+1-949-468-2750"},
  ]

  # Search for name
  name = input("Name: ")
  for person in people:
      if person["name"] == name:
          number = person["number"]
          print(f"Found {number}")
          break
  else:
      print("Not found")
  ```

  Notice how `people` is implemented as a list of dictionaries, separated by commas. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/3/phonebook3.py?download).
* Python has done their best to get to *constant time* using their built-in searches.
* You can learn more about dictionaries in the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict)

<a id="command-line-arguments"></a>

#### Command-Line Arguments

* As with C, you can also utilize command-line arguments. Consider the following code:

  ```py
  # Prints a command-line argument

  from sys import argv

  if len(argv) == 2:
      print(f"hello, {argv[1]}")
  else:
      print("hello, world")
  ```

  Notice that `argv[1]` is printed using a *formatted string*, noted by the `f` present in the `print` statement. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/2/greet.py?download).
* You can learn more about the `sys` library in the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html)

<a id="exit-status"></a>

#### Exit Status

* The `sys` library also has built-in methods. We can use `sys.exit(i)` to exit the program with a specific exit code:

  ```py
  # Exits with explicit value, importing sys

  import sys

  if len(sys.argv) != 2:
      print("Missing command-line argument")
      sys.exit(1)

  print(f"hello, {sys.argv[1]}")
  sys.exit(0)
  ```

  Notice that dot-notation is used to utilize the built-in functions of `sys`. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/2/exit.py?download).

<a id="csv-files"></a>

#### CSV Files

* Python also has built-in support for CSV files.
* Modify your code for `phonebook.py` as follows:

  ```py
  import csv

  file = open("phonebook.csv", "a")

  name = input("Name: ")
  number = input("Number: ")

  writer = csv.writer(file)
  writer.writerow([name,number])

  file.close()
  ```

  Notice `writerow` adds the commas in the CSV file for us. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/4/phonebook0.py?download).
* While `file.close` and `file = open` are commonly used and available syntax in Python, this code can be improved as follows:

  ```py
  # Uses `with`

  import csv

  # Get name and number
  name = input("Name: ")
  number = input("Number: ")

  # Open CSV file
  with open("phonebook.csv", "a") as file:

      # Print to file
      writer = csv.writer(file)
      writer.writerow([name, number])
  ```

  Notice that the code is indented under the `with` statement. This automatically closes the file when done. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/4/phonebook1.py?download).
* Similarly, we can write a dictionary as follows within the CSV file:

  ```py
  import csv

  name = input("Name: ")
  number = input("Number: ")

  with open("phonebook.csv", "a") as file:

      writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames=["name", "number"])
      writer.writerow({"name": name, "number": number})
  ```

  Notice this code is quite similar to our prior iteration but with `csv.DictWriter` instead. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/4/phonebook2.py?download).

<a id="third-party-libraries"></a>

#### Third-Party Libraries

* One of the advantages of Python is its massive user base and similarly large number of third-party libraries.
* You can install the CS50 Library on your own computer by typing `pip install cs50`, provided you have [Python](https://python.org) installed.
* Considering other libraries, David demoed the use of `cowsay` and `qrcode`.

<a id="summing-up"></a>
